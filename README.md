# Pokemon-Stadium-2-Randomizer
A randomizer for gym leader castle, so far. Combine with rental rando for best outcomes.

This is a randomizer for Pokemon Stadium 2. What this does is randomizes movesets of all rental Pokemon. In addition, all the Pokemon belonging to trainers in the Gym Leader Castle have been randomized along with their movesets. This creates a new ROM for you in a ROM folder in the directory where the original was. THE ORIGINAL IS NOT MODIFIED. Also, runners can share their experience without sharing ROMs by the seed entry option. 0 is random.

Rentals are now randomized everywhere.

There are three optional checkboxes. You can select 'Metronome Only' to offer a truly random experience. Or you can check 'Leader has legendary,' which ensures the leader has Mewtwo, Mew, Ho-oh, Lugia, or Celebi. Or you can check 'randomize happiness,' which affects the strength of return/frustration, a move based on whether you have high or low happiness, respectively.

There is also a neat feature where you can choose trainer names and the trainer names are randomized from that pool. 11 characters is the limit. Any longer names will be cut off at randomization time. Also removed are strings of length 1 or lower.

NOTE:

-Text gets changed to purple automatically when a Pokemon knows a move it shouldn't.

-Pokemon portraits (the icon in the HUD) are bugged. This is merely aesthetic. This was a result of randomizing the Pokemon.

***Note***

Seed number does not take into account checkboxes

# Known bugs

-There is an issue where this hack won't run when pj64 is not in debug mode

~~Enabling random items breaks Pokemon you select~~

~~There's a problem with your inventory if you cancel the final check~~

~~Currently, there's a problem if you do metronome only. ***Intended fix***: Take out PP consumption in that mode.~~
