# Pokemon-Stadium-2-Randomizer
A randomizer for gym leader castle, so far. Combine with rental rando for best outcomes.

This is a randomizer for Pokemon Stadium 2. What this does is randomizes movesets of all rental Pokemon. In addition, all the Pokemon belonging to trainers in the Gym Leader Castle have been randomized. This creates a new ROM for you in a ROM folder in the directory where the original was. THE ORIGINAL IS NOT MODIFIED. Also, runners can share their experience without sharing ROMs by the seed entry option. 0 is random.

There are two optional checkboxes. You can select 'Metronome Only' to offer a truly random experience. Or you can check 'Leader has legendary,' which ensures the leader has Mewtwo, Mew, Ho-oh, Lugia, or Celebi.

There is also a neat feature where you can choose trainer names and the trainer names are randomized from that pool. 11 characters is the limit. Any longer names will be cut off at randomization time. Also removed are strings of length 1 or lower.

NOTE:

-Text gets changed to purple automatically when a Pokemon knows a move it shouldn't.

-Pokemon portraits (the icon in the HUD) are bugged. This is merely aesthetic. This was a result of randomizing the Pokemon.

# Known bugs

Currently, there's a problem if you do metronome only. ***Intended fix***: Take out PP consumption in that mode.
